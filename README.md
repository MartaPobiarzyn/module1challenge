# module1challenge


This project was a refactored web page for a marketing agency called Horiseon. They wanted to fix the current state of their home page, which was filled with non-semantic HTML and CSS, and make it more accessible to people with impairments.

The code now includes appropriate semantic HTML elements, descriptions of images for screen readers and SEO purposes, and all the changes are reflected in the CSS so the visual appearance of the website did not change.
